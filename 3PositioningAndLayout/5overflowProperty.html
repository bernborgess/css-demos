	<h3>The Overflow Property</h3>

	<p>
		As discussed earlier, every element on the page
		is a <b>box</b>. If the height of the box is not set, the 
		height of that box will grow as large as necessary
		to accomodate the content.
	</p>

	<div id="div1">
		This text is inside the div element, which
		has a blue 
		background-color and is floated to the 
		left. We set a specific
		height and width for the div element, and
		as you can see, 
		the content cannot fit.
	</div>
	<br />
	<i>The CSS <b>overflow</b> property specifies the 
		behavior that occurs when an element's
		content overflows the element's box.</i>
		<br><br><br><br>
		<br><br><br><br>
		<br><br><br><br>
		
		<h3>The overflow Property Values</h3>
		
		<p>
			There are four values for the overflow property:
			<b>visible</b> (the default value), <b>scroll, hidden</b> and
			<b>auto</b>.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			The value <b>scroll</b> results in clipped overflow, but a 
			scrollbar is added, so the rest of the content may
			be seen.
		</p>
		<div id="div2">
			This text is inside the div element, which
			has a blue 
			background-color and is floated to the 
			left. We set a specific
			height and width for the div element, and
			as you can see, 
			the content is seen by scrolling.
		</div>
		
		<i>The code above will produce both <b>horizontal</b> and
			<b>vertical</b> scrollbars.</i>
			<br><br><br><br>
			<br><br><br><br>
			
			
			<h3>auto and hidden</h3>
			<p>
				<b>auto</b> - If overflow is clipped, a scroll-bar shoud be
				added to make it possible to see the rest of the 
				content.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>hidden</b> - The overflow is clipped, and the rest of 
				the content will be invisible.
			</p>
			<div id="div3">
				This text is inside the div element, which
				has a blue 
				background-color and is floated to the 
				left. We set a specific
				height and width for the div element, and
				as you can see, 
				the content is occluded.
			</div>

			<i>The default value for the overflow property is <b>visible</b></i>
