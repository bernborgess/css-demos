	<h3>Floating</h3>
	<p>
		With CSS float, an element ca be pushed to 
		the left or right, allowing other elements to wrap
		around it.
	</p>
	<p>
		Float is often used with images, but it is also
		useful when working with layouts.
	</p>
	<p>
		The values for the float property are <b>left, right</b>
		and <b>none</b>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Left and right float elements in those directions, 
		respectively. <b>none</b> (the default) ensures that the
		element will not float.
	</p>
	<p>
		Below is an example of an image that is floated to the right.
	</p>
	<br>
	
	<p class="floatRight"><img class="nyan" src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41HXUK8edZL.png" />
		This paragraph has an image that is floated 
		to the <b>right</b>. 
		It is highly recommended to add a margin to 
		images so that the text does 
		not get too close to the image. If you want
		your text to be easily read, you 
		should always add a few pixels between
		words and borders, iamges,
		and other content.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Elements are floated horizontally, meaning
		that an element can only be floated left or right,
		not up or down.
