	<h2>Setting Styles to Links</h2>
	<p>
		Links can be styled with any CSS property (e.g., color, font-family, background, etc.).
	</p>
	<p>
		In addition, links can be styled differently, depending on what state they are
		in. The following pseudo selectors are available:
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>a:link</b> - defines the style for normal unvisited links
	</p>
	<p>	
		<b>a:visited</b> - defines the style for visited links
	</p>
	<p>	
		<b>a:active</b> - a link becomes active once you click on it
	</p>
	<p>	
		<b>a:hover</b> - a link is hovered when the mouse is over it
	</p>
	<p>
		The example below creates a link that will change the style when the mouse is moved over it.
	</p>

	<p><a href="" target="_blank">This link is hovered when we mouse over it</a></p>
	
	<p>
		When setting the style for several link states,
		there are some order rules:
	</p>
	<p>
		a:hover MUST come after a:link and a:visited
	</p>
	<p>
		a:active MUST come after a:hover
	</p>


	<p>
		By default, text links are underline by the browser.
	</p>
	<p>
		One of the most common uses of CSS with links
		is to <b>remove the underline</b>. In the example below,
		the <b>text-decoration</b> property is used to remove
		the underline.
	</p>
